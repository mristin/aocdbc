2022.8.15
=========
This is a release corresponding to our publication at FSE 2022 demo track.

2021.7.10rc1
============
This is the very first release candidate.
Some exercises are still missing and minor tweaks prior to our Europython 2021 talk are expected.

We still need to decide how we want to structure the buggy programs.
At the moment, they are stored as "recorded failures" in the repository.
We deliberately exclude them from the distribution as they are not really release-worthy.
