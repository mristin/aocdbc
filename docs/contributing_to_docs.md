## Style Guide

**Headings.**
Use the following heading style from [Sphinx tutorial][sphinx-sections]:

[sphinx-sections]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections

* `#` with overline, for parts
* `*` with overline, for chapters
* `=`, for sections
* `-`, for subsections
* `^`, for subsubsections
* `â€œ`, for paragraphs

**Line length.**
Do not use line limit.

Put sentences on individual lines to make diff'ing easier.
