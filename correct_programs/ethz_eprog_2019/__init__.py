Provide exercises and solutions from an introductory lecture at ETH Zurich.

We translated the exercises from the lecture "Einf√ºhrung in die Programmierung"
(252-0027) held at ETH Zurich as part of the Computer Science curriculum in Fall 2019.

We picked only the subset of the exercises. The original exercises encompassed broader
topics than programming (such as EBNF), so we skipped them.
Additionally, we skipped the exercises such as the Exercise 0 which introduced
the students to version control and usage of IDEs. As the course was meant to teach
Java, some exercises focused on Java-specific topics. Since we are collecting a corpus
of Python programs annotated with contracts, we skipped such exercises as we did not
deem them relevant for the corpus. Finally, we excluded the problems which we thought
were too trivial for the corpus such as dealing with basic input/output operations
(such as Exercise 2, Problem 4).

The original text of the problems is much longer and more elaborate. We focus on the
source code, so we shortened the text as much as possible and give it here only as
orientation about the complexity of the exercises. Please refer to the original text
(in German) for details.

The content of the exercises is courtesy of Laboratory for Software Technology,
ETH Zurich, which also bears the copyright.
