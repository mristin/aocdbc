"""
Compute the angles of the clock hands for a given time of the day.

The 00:00:00 corresponds to the angle zero, increasing to the right. (This was *not*
part of the original problem statement, but we introduce it here for simplicity of the
solution.)

(We change slightly the statement so that it focuses on what we thought the "core" part
of the problem. The original problem additionally concerns the drawing of the clock
hands in the GUI which we intentionally leave out as Java-specific and not relevant
in terms of contracts.)
