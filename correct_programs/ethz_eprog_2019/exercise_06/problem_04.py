"""
Implement a linked list which stores integers.

Provide the following operations:
* ``add_first``,
* ``remove_first``,
* ``remove_last``,
* ``clear``,
* ``is_empty``,
* ``get`` (at index),
* ``set`` (at index), and
* ``iterate`` (over all the elements of the list).

(We substantially shortened the text of this problem to only give the crux of the
problem and leave out the parts with user input/output. Please refer to the original
exercise in german for exact details.)
