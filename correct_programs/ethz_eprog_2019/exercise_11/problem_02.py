Evaluate mathematical expressions.

Please see `page 3`_ and `page 4`_ of Exercise 11.

First, provide a tokenizer and a parser for the mathematical expressions.

Second, evaluate the mathematical expressions. The functions ``cos``, ``sin`` and
``tan`` need to be supported. The evaluation function is given a dictionary of parameter
values.

An exception should be raised if a parameter has not been specified.
